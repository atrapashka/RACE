RACE 🏎️ - my graduation project of courses in TMS <img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6335-6464-4433-b637-303934383839/zoub1wL7Zo0-3.jpg" width="35">

It's a simple racing game with some sort of humor and beautiful design and animations.

There's some special things about it:
- I use my favourite game from chilhood for inspiriation - AirStrike, thats why RACE looks in similar way
- There is some easter eggs 🥚 in this app and you can try to find them
- I've spent a lot of time to make animations in RACE looks smooth and beautiful
- It's my first big project, so RACE has a special place in my heart ❤️
- Planning to add: user autorization, language localization, CoreData, Audio
- Planning to improve: code, animations, UI/UX, source images of objects, game difficulty
